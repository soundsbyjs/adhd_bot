# What is this?

This is a little side project I'm working on. Definitely one of the more silly projects I've had in mind, but I wanted to write some Python. 
Sue me.
The idea is to make AI generated content for TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. 
More information on where you can see the project in action elsewhere coming shortly.

I hate these apps and would love to see them ruined by a ton of automated content, flooding out the poor, crippled, addicted masses.
You are free to use and distribute this code as you please.
Copy me directly.

I am greatly inspired by Andy Warhol with this project. Don't ask why. This is art.
